        "SALES       Summary     When thinking of the timeline of my career, numerous bullet points come to mind.  Whether it be a skill or achievement that I can bring to the table,  there is one common denominator that all of these personal traits fall under: Teamwork.  Regardless of what job I may have had in the past, whether it be music education, recruiting, or sales, understanding that I am  existing within/leading a team allows me to clearly understand the task at hand. Communication is the number one element to a successful team.  A prolonged lack of communication can manifest itself into a negative environment, and it has been my number one priority to make sure everyone involved is on the same page.       Highlights          6+ years of B2B sales experience.  MS Office proficiency  Team building expert  Proven sales track record  Detail-oriented  Sales management      Sales  Purchasing  Quotations  Accounts receivable  Customer service  CAD experience            Accomplishments     Handled the highest volume account for current employer  Developed profitable sales strategy with new product for longtime customer   Project Management \u00a0   Supervised project production efforts to ensure projects were completed to company standards, on time and within budget constraints.         Experience      Sales   01/2007   to   02/2016     Company Name   City  ,   State       Initially hired as warehouse manager.  Oversaw receiving inventory into stock, maintaining stock, as well as pulling and shipping orders as needed.  Primarily used UPS Worldship for ground and LTL packages/pallets.  Promoted to inside sales position in 2010 In charge of DAR's largest contracted customer.  Main responsibilities involve processing large stock orders which pulled inventory from three different locations as well as drop ship orders.  Responsible for replenishing stock as needed.  Large customer service portion involved with this account.  Fielded technical and specification questions through conference calls between our company's customer as well as the end user customer.  Coordinated inspections for return items that were either defective, incorrectly supplied or did not meet the customer's needs.  Purchasing, sales, customer service as well as quotations all fall under the job description of an inside sales representative at DAR since it is a small family owned business.  Strictly defined roles are not a part of this job.  Various situations required different people to take on various responsibilities which is where communication between all stages of an order is pivotal to success.  The quotation process would be the most technical aspect of my time at D.A.R.  Calculating yields on material needed, required amount of labor (what type of labor) as well as the appropriate mark-up for any given product required constant communication between myself and the employees working the fabrication shop.  My greatest feeling of satisfaction came from quoting something never done by the company before and having that turn into an actual order.  Acquired new business for a longtime customer through competitive quotes and quick lead times for orders.  A close attention to inventory management resulted in quick lead times by making sure stock was available for custom items that customer started to purchase.  Every aspect of training for the inside sales position at D.A.R. was on the job. This gives me great confidence to branch out into other industries if so given the chance.          Music Teacher/Camp Counselor   01/2003   to   01/2007     Company Name   City  ,   State       Began as music school receptionist.

After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB.  In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.\u00a0 Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from 30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.

        "EDUCATION OFFICER & SENIOR EDUCATION OFFICER GUIDANCE & COUNSELING UNIT       Professional Summary     I joined the Ministry of Education in 1982 and was posted at the R.M.Bailey Senior High School where I remained for seventeen and a half wonderful years.  I served as Head of the Guidance Department from 1991 to 1999 until my redeployment to Special Services Section to oversee the Guidance & Counseling Unit upon the retirement of the former officer.  I enjoyed my experience at R.M.Baily and have had the pleasure of working with and assisting students even after my departure from the school, I am still counseling many of them and their children today.     I have had the opportunity of supervising the Guidance & Counseling Unit over the past sixteen years and watched it grow from forty- two (42) counselors in 1999 to one hundred and thirty two (132) in 2015, posted in ninety-four schools on fourteen islands and cays throughout the country.  During my leadership, we collaborated with the College of The Bahamas and Kent State University and established a Master's of Education Degree Program in School Counseling from 2001 to 2011.  Eighty- nine (89) persons obtained the Masters Degree, and the unit has the largest amount of employees with this Degree in the Ministry of Education.   I realized in order for the unit to move forward, ongoing training was a requirement for all officers, which kept them informed about the latest techniques and strengthened areas of concern.   We also established a crisis team that assists with grief and disaster counseling.    The needs of students were being met but those of the employees were not and after visiting the school district in Dallas Texas, I learned about the Employee Assistance Program, and implemented it at the Ministry of Education on a smaller scale.  This proved to be very successful but  the need for expansion was necessary. Upon the retirement of Mrs. Pansy Hamilton Brown, Iris Strachan, and Clevette Gibson took the  reins and took EAP to the next level.  The demands on the officers made me realize that the service needed to be made available to all government employees and the idea to expand the service was decided.   I enjoyed my role as Senior Education Officer and if given the opportunity would like to be a part of taking EAP to the next level.            Core Qualifications          Experienced in individual and group counseling   Sound knowledge of Erik Erikson developmental stages from birth to death   outstanding planning and organizational skills   Exceptional communication skills and outstanding leadership qualities   Flexible, enthusiastic and enjoys working with people   Solution focus      Unique knack in identifying and improving counselors and clients potential   Skilled in MS Office and researching on the Internet   effective listener and Critical thinker skills  Outstanding interpersonal and rapport building skills .

The program is a voluntary or referral \u2018work-based program that offers free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services to employees who have personal and/or work-related problems'.

It is a system which receives data from the Legacy Warehouse systems and stores it in the S&D Information Warehouse.  The whole transmission system consists of two parts: 1) The sending part on Legacy Warehouse Country side 2) The receiving part on S&D IW side For each sending system exists in the S&D IW one dedicated receiving System.  The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS.  Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one.  A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program.  Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table.  Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format.  The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.  This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.  If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.

Client:  Intel USA I am currently being trained in Genesys tool and 10nm Intel flow.  I am working on blocks like LDO to begin with.  Client:  Qualcomm Pvt Ltd India  WTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 14FF (Samsung foundry) : Duration of project - 6 months I managed a team of 6 who worked on WTR synth project done in 14FF Samsung foundry.  This is one of the most challenging tasks in my career, as this is the first RF task that I have worked in FF technologies.  To overcome the challenges I have undergone various FinFet related trainings to understand the process and its impact on layout.        Experience      Engineering Project Manager  ,   12/2012   to   06/2017    Company Name          I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.  I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.  These sheets certainly helped us to plan the next project much better.  WTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 6 months I lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA.  My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables.  I also handled some portion of the TOP level layout tasks.  I worked on blocks like HFVCO, Regulator, VCO Buffer and LPF during this project.  I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.  I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.  WTR QLNA Daisy Chain 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months For this particular project I had regular discussions with the Packaging team to create the best Daisy Chain structures for a WLP CHIP which I had work on previously.  I also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB.  WTR QLNA Metal Variants Tapeout 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months We needed metal variants for the QLNA chip which I previously worked on.  In design we leave scope for meal options which can be used to study certain features better during testing.  Here I worked on creating four chips with different metal variant options.  I also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB.  WTR QLNA in 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 5 months This was my first project in 180nm TSMC process.  In this project I mentored one other junior in my team who worked on MBIAS block while I worked in creating the LNA.  WTR RX BBF in 28nm (TSMC/UMC) : Duration of project - 4 months I lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA.  My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables using Gantt chart and XL sheet.  I worked on the top level and few sub-blocks of BBF in this project.  WTR FBRX in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 4 months This task was about working on FBRX module which was previously done.  There we few issues seen with this blocks performance in post silicon verifications.  My role in this task was to identify the IQ imbalance which caused performance issues and fix them.  I was able to meet the designers requirements in this task and was very much appreciated by him once the task was done.  WTR Low Band Low Noise Amplifier 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 3 months This is a Low Band LNA which operates between 860 - 900 Mhz frequencies.  Here layout constraints like coupling, inductance and symmetry were taken care while doing layout.  Majorly the input devices to which RF_IN signal were given extra care w.r.t coupling and symmetry.  WTR Mixer, Attenuator in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 10 months This is the first project which I worked on in RF domain and I had a wonderful experience working on this project.  The blocks that I worked in this project were for a product chip and hence the amount of learning was tremendous in this project.  The blocks were ready on time with good quality.

Additional Comments    I have been working in the Aviation industry for 12 years now and bring with me a total on 15 years of experience that makes me a well-seasoned professional. I bring with me experience of working with commercial, military, charter, and prototype aircraft. I am experienced and knowledgeable with Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Dornier, and Lockheed and have proven myself to be both versatile when working with various aircraft makes & customers.          Experience     January 2011   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchaser / Production Coordinator        My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.  In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.  I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these parts as necessary.  When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate paperwork to purchasing.  Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.  Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.  Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.  In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.  Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where buyers spend more time on parts themselves.  Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.  I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.  If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.  Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.  We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.  Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.  In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an industry standard to rise above the competition.  Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.  These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.  Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is key in this position.         February 2009   to   December 2010     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist        Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different     responsibilities.  Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse, Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities.  Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.  After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.  If needed, get approval to proceed with the order.  Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.  I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.  Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.  Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.  All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.  I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid, or items that that have already been received.  As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.  If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.  As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.  This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.  Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being ordered and used for an Aircraft.         February 2005   to   January 2009     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor        I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.  Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.  I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.  This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.  My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.  This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.  I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a timely fashion.  Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.  I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.  With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.  In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.  This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.  Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.  Clientlogic (DELL).

        "ASP.NET WEB DEVELOPER           Accomplishments      Won Associate of the Month award at CYIENT  Member of the team which won the Team of the Month award for projects such as DEBTS and eRFA        Experience     April 2015   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State     ASP.Net Web Developer        Responsibilities:  Migration of IU Print website (print.iu.edu) from ColdFusion to ASP.Net using MVC Framework.  Create a prototype dashboard for IU Print Analytics module using High Charts.         July 2011   to   July 2014     Company Name   City  ,   State     Software Engineer        Responsibilities:  Designed and developed an application to migrate legacy data to ASP.Net application by providing the ability to validate the data to meet the business rules for the new application.  Design the story board using HTML and CSS and design database for applications by analyzing the customer requirements.  Perform code reviews of the modules developed by other team members and participate in pair programming to improve the coding standards of the overall application.  Preparation of build packages and actively participate in integration and deployment phase of the applications. TECHNICALS SKILLS: Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio 2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1) LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3) Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.
