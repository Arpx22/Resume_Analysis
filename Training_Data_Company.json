I hold expert knowledge in applying technology to business processes resulting in a more cost effective and efficient enterprise.  My accomplishments as a major player in the successful pioneering and implementation of the \"Paperless Office\" in 33 local Virginia agencies, created a paradigm shift in the culture of how agencies currently do business.  The experience of being a road warrior leading the day to day \"hands on\" training of the user afforded me a \"real life\" work experience and invaluable insight in user training needs, challenges, acceptance and buy-in.  The knowledge I gained from the users resulted into successful problem solving, change management and implementation outcomes of enterprise management systems. This kind of knowledge and experience cannot be gained in a classroom or from a white paper.  I have a strong ability to quickly capture business rules, policies, procedures, workflow issues, functional requirements and resolve client and technical roadblocks hindering successful implementation.  I maintain a reputation of improving the work environment via technology and delivering a solution that surpasses client expectations. Strong analytical skills used in business and requirements analysis for a variety of industries. Keen problem solving skills allowing rapid assimilation and resolution of complex problems.

The whole transmission system consists of two parts: 1) The sending part on Legacy Warehouse Country side 2) The receiving part on S&D IW side For each sending system exists in the S&D IW one dedicated receiving System.  The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS.  Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one.  A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program.  Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table.  Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format.  The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.  This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.  If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.

Client:  Intel USA I am currently being trained in Genesys tool and 10nm Intel flow.  I am working on blocks like LDO to begin with.  Client:  Qualcomm Pvt Ltd India  WTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 14FF (Samsung foundry) : Duration of project - 6 months I managed a team of 6 who worked on WTR synth project done in 14FF Samsung foundry.  This is one of the most challenging tasks in my career, as this is the first RF task that I have worked in FF technologies.  To overcome the challenges I have undergone various FinFet related trainings to understand the process and its impact on layout.        Experience      Engineering Project Manager  ,   12/2012   to   06/2017    Company Name          I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.  I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.  These sheets certainly helped us to plan the next project much better.  WTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 6 months I lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA.  My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables.  I also handled some portion of the TOP level layout tasks.  I worked on blocks like HFVCO, Regulator, VCO Buffer and LPF during this project.  I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.  I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.  WTR QLNA Daisy Chain 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months For this particular project I had regular discussions with the Packaging team to create the best Daisy Chain structures for a WLP CHIP which I had work on previously.  I also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB.  WTR QLNA Metal Variants Tapeout 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months We needed metal variants for the QLNA chip which I previously worked on.  In design we leave scope for meal options which can be used to study certain features better during testing.  Here I worked on creating four chips with different metal variant options.  I also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB.  WTR QLNA in 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 5 months This was my first project in 180nm TSMC process.  In this project I mentored one other junior in my team who worked on MBIAS block while I worked in creating the LNA.  WTR RX BBF in 28nm (TSMC/UMC) : Duration of project - 4 months I lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA.  My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables using Gantt chart and XL sheet.  I worked on the top level and few sub-blocks of BBF in this project.  WTR FBRX in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 4 months This task was about working on FBRX module which was previously done.  There we few issues seen with this blocks performance in post silicon verifications.  My role in this task was to identify the IQ imbalance which caused performance issues and fix them.  I was able to meet the designers requirements in this task and was very much appreciated by him once the task was done.  WTR Low Band Low Noise Amplifier 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 3 months This is a Low Band LNA which operates between 860 - 900 Mhz frequencies.  Here layout constraints like coupling, inductance and symmetry were taken care while doing layout.  Majorly the input devices to which RF_IN signal were given extra care w.r.t coupling and symmetry.  WTR Mixer, Attenuator in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 10 months This is the first project which I worked on in RF domain and I had a wonderful experience working on this project.  The blocks that I worked in this project were for a product chip and hence the amount of learning was tremendous in this project.  The blocks were ready on time with good quality.

Additional Comments    I have been working in the Aviation industry for 12 years now and bring with me a total on 15 years of experience that makes me a well-seasoned professional. I bring with me experience of working with commercial, military, charter, and prototype aircraft. I am experienced and knowledgeable with Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Dornier, and Lockheed and have proven myself to be both versatile when working with various aircraft makes & customers.          Experience     January 2011   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchaser / Production Coordinator        My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.  In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.  I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these parts as necessary.  When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate paperwork to purchasing.  Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.  Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.  Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.  In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.  Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where buyers spend more time on parts themselves.  Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.  I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.  If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.  Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.  We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.  Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.  In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an industry standard to rise above the competition.  Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.  These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.  Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is key in this position.         February 2009   to   December 2010     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist        Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different     responsibilities.  Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse, Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities.  Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.  After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.  If needed, get approval to proceed with the order.  Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.  I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.  Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.  Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.  All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.  I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid, or items that that have already been received.  As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.  If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.  As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.  This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.  Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being ordered and used for an Aircraft.         February 2005   to   January 2009     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor        I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.  Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.  I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.  This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.  My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.  This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.  I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a timely fashion.  Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.  I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.  With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.  In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.  This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.  Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.  Clientlogic (DELL).

It is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending).

The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.
